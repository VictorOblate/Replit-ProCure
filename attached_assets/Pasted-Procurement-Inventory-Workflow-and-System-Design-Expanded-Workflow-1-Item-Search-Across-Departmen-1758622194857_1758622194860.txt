Procurement + Inventory Workflow and System Design
Expanded Workflow
1. Item Search Across Departments

User checks stock across all departments.

If available → Initiates borrow request.

(i) User inputs item name, description, and quantity needed.

(ii) User’s Department HOD reviews and approves.

(iii) Borrow request is routed to the owning department.

(iv) Owning Department HOD reviews and either approves or declines.

(v) If approved → Borrow transaction logged, stock deducted from lending department, and added to borrower department.

If unavailable → Initiate purchase requisition.

2. Purchase Requisition

User creates requisition with detailed item attributes (name, description, estimated cost, justification, required date, etc.).

Department HOD reviews and either approves or declines.

Procurement Manager reviews next.

Finance Department performs budget availability check and either approves or declines. Only after Finance approval can the requisition proceed to quotation stage.

3. Vendor Quotation & Purchase Order

Procurement Manager requests quotations from onboarded vendors.

Quotations compared and evaluated (best price, delivery timeline, vendor rating).

Selected quotation → Purchase Order (PO) created.

PO follows approval chain: HOD → Procurement Manager → Finance.

Once Finance signs off on the PO, it is sent to the vendor and Finance for payment initiation.

4. Vendor Management

Procurement Manager can onboard vendors (with details: company name, registration, contacts, categories, compliance docs).

Vendors must be approved and active before receiving RFQs or POs.

Procurement Manager monitors vendor performance (timeliness, quality, pricing consistency).

5. Stock Monitoring and Usage

Every department’s inventory continuously tracked.

Attributes per stock item:

Item code, name, description

Quantity available

Quantity reserved (for pending requests)

Unit of measure (e.g., packs, liters)

Usage history (log of consumption, borrow, return)

Minimum reorder level (system alerts when reached)

Example: If department had 10 water packages and 4 were consumed, system shows 6 remaining and logs usage event.

Borrowing process checks real-time available stock before allowing requests.

Reports show consumption trends, top used items, and anomalies (e.g., sudden surge in usage).

6. Approval Hierarchy (Mandatory)

Step 1: Department HOD

Step 2: Procurement Manager

Step 3: Finance Department (budget validation and final approval)

This sequence applies to all workflows: borrow requests, purchase requisitions, purchase orders.

Major System Requirements

Automated Stock Deduction

Each approved usage (consumption) or borrow request automatically deducts the corresponding quantity from inventory.

Deduction must reflect instantly across departments to avoid double-booking.

Reorder Alerts

System generates real-time alerts (email, in-app, or SMS) when stock levels fall below predefined reorder thresholds.

Alerts visible to HOD, Procurement Manager, and Finance for proactive replenishment.

Audit Logging

Comprehensive logs for all actions: approvals, rejections, stock movements, and vendor interactions.

Each log entry must capture: user ID, timestamp, action performed, and data affected.

Audit trail ensures traceability for compliance and accountability.

System Attributes
User Roles

General User: Can search, initiate borrow or purchase requisition.

HOD: Approves/declines requests from department.

Procurement Manager: Oversees all procurement activities, vendor management, quotation comparisons.

Finance Officer: Confirms budget availability and gives final approval.

Vendor: External role, responds to RFQs, receives POs.

Features Needed

Centralized stock database (with per-department visibility).

Borrow request workflow with full approval chain.

Purchase requisition and order workflow with full approval chain.

Vendor onboarding and management module.

Automated stock deduction upon approvals.

Reorder alerts for low stock levels.

Audit logs for all transactions and approvals.

Reporting dashboards:
